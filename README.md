# Allstar Security Policy Enforcement

## Overview

This repository outlines the security policy enforcement for the OpenTelemetry organization, using the Allstar GitHub App. Allstar helps enforce security best practices by automatically checking and ensuring our repositories comply with our established policies.

## Configured Allstar Actions

Allstar is configured to take the following action upon detecting a policy violation within any repository in the OpenTelemetry organization:
- **issue**: For each violation, Allstar will create a GitHub issue within the affected repository. If the issue remains open and unchanged for more than 36 hours, it will be pinged with a comment every 36 hours. The issue will be automatically closed by Allstar once the violation is resolved.

## Enforced Policies

The following Allstar security policies are actively enforced across the OpenTelemetry organization's repositories:

### Repository Administrators Policy
- Ensures that each repository has assigned administrators.
- Maintains that teams are designated as administrators.

### GitHub Actions Policy
- Monitors GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they adhere to our security rules.
- Checks for the use of static security scans within the workflows.

### Binary Artifacts Policy
- Prevents binary artifacts from being committed to the repositories.
- Ensures that source code is human-readable and free from hidden vulnerabilities.

### Branch Protection Policy
- Verifies that the main branches (e.g., `main`) have branch protection rules enforced, such as required reviews, status checks, and more.

### SECURITY.md Policy
- Checks that a security policy file named `SECURITY.md` is present and properly filled out in each repository. This file should detail how to report security vulnerabilities.
